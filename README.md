# Tracking COVID-19

This is a repository for documenting research related to COVID-19.

This project is built primarily upon the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org) and using the latest [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publication infrastructure.

We will be updating research and information related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and hopefully beyond that!
